Hi, my name is Krishan Kumar. I am a research scholar at The English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in English, with particular focus on English literture. This early engagement with texts and narratives laid the foundation for my curiosity about how language operates not only as a medium of expression but also asa mirror of society and human experience.
It led me to pursue a Masters degree in Linguistics from The English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. The research areas that interest me are Acosutic Phonetics, Sociophonetics, and Sociolinguistics. I also take a keen interest in the phenomenon of language contact and change.

My research focuses on the sociophonetic study of Bagri, a regional variety spoken in Haryana. In particular, I analyze the acoustic properties of consonants in the Charkhi Dadri variety of Bagri and examine how they differ from Standard Bagri. My work also looks beyond the purely linguistic domain: I am interested in how Bagri speech is socially perceived, often stereotyped as aggressive or harsh, and how such non-linguistic cues influence attitudes toward speakers and their identity. I believe in open science practices and that linguistic research should remain accessible to the communities who contribute their voices and stories to it. Alongside my academic work, I take a deep interest in teaching and sharing what I have learned, whether from classroom study or from on-field academic and non-academic experiences.

Outside of linguistics, I enjoy watching and playing football, which, perhaps not coincidentally, also played a role in sparking my interest in languages. I have completed an Advanced Diploma of Proficiency in Spanish, and I am now planning to learn Portuguese as well. While I am not particularly inclined toward activities like painting, singing, or dancing, I find satisfaction in the skills I do have, and in the ways they connect me to both language and culture.
