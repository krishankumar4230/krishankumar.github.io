Research Scholar (Linguistics and Phonetics)


- [About](/about/)

Hi, my name is Krishan. I am a research scholar a The English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad.

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in English, with particular focus on English literature. This early engagement with texts and narratives laid the foundation for my curiosity about how language operates not only as a medium of expression but also as a mirror of society and human experience. It led me to pursue a Master's degree in Linguistics from The English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad. The research areas that interest me are Acoustic Phonetics, Sociophonetics, and Sociolinguistics. I also take a keen interest in the phenomenon of language contact and change.

My research focuses on the sociophonetic study of Bagri, a regional variety spoken in Haryana. In particular, I analyze the acoustic properties of consonants in the Charkhi Dadri variety of Bagri and examine how they differ from Standard Bagri. My work also looks beyond the purely linguistic domain: I am interested in how Bagri speech is socially perceived, often stereotyped as aggressive or harsh, and how such non-linguistic cues influence attitudes toward speakers and their identity. 

In addition to my academic work, I take a deep interest in teaching and sharing what I have learned, whether from classroom study or from on-field academic and non-academic experiences.

Other than that, I enjoy playing, watching and talking about football, which, perhaps not coincidentally, also played a role in sparking my interest in languages. I have completed an Advanced Diploma of Proficiency in Spanish, and I hope to learn Portuguese as well, purely out of my a passion for football. I say this as a joke that one of my dreams is to some day live somewhere in Portugal or Spain, and find myself a debut in League-32 (I do not know if that exists). 

I believe in open science practices, and hence it is my opinion that linguistic research should remain accessible to the communities that contribute their voices and stories to it.
